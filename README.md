# Description
In this file structure I focused on creating a readme generator to help speed up your coding projects using only node.js and javascript function. As simple as placing your information into your command line and watch the code do the rest!

# Installation

So how does it work?

Git clone my repository code either with the http or ssh key to your local project folder

If you dont already have NPM on your cpu make sure to run npm init to install it in your current folder. once you do that you are going to want to install the inquirer 

go to https://www.npmjs.com to install the inquirer package into your folder and follow instructions on how to download.
once installed

once you run the code "Node app" into the command line (terminal) the inquirer  will prompt you with questions you will need to answer to generate your Readme.


After answering all the questions you will find your readme in the dist folder under the file name of "readme.md"
